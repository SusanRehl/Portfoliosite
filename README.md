# Personal Portfolio Website

Personal software development and graphic design portfolio website.
Site was created with AngularJS, Angular UI Boostrap and Angular Routes (plus HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, NodeJS, Express, and PostgreSQL database).

## https://susanrehl.herokuapp.com

Sections include:
- Software development projects
- Graphic design and marketing projects
- Photography, artwork (watercolor and acrylic painting, and drawing).

This site is under constant development, as I try out new technologies and add new features.
