# "Adventures" Personal Portfolio Website

Personal software development and graphic design portfolio website, chronicling my learning adventures.
Site was created with AngularJS and Angular Routes (plus HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, NodeJS, Express, and PostgreSQL database).

Sections include:
- Software development projects
- Graphic design and marketing projects
- Hobbies, including travel and nature photography, artwork (watercolor and acrylic painting, and drawing), and my two cats.

This site is under constant development! I will continually add more content, and try out new code to create new features.
